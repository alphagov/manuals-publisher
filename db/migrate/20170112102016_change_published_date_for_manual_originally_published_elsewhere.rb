# The history
# ===========
#
# The National Planning Policy Framework manual was originally published
# in March 2012, and recently migrated over to GOV.UK.  The version now
# published says it was updated on in Dec 2016 as that's when it was
# first published to GOV.UK, however, no changes were made to the content
# and this date is causing users of the manual to get in touch to find
# out what has changed.  The app doesn't (yet) have the ability to override
# the dates in the UI, nor does it have the ability to set the change
# notes for sections when they are first created.
#
# What we'll do here is edit the change notes to read "Imported to GOV.UK"
# instead of "New section added" and republish the manual and it's sections
# so that the public_updated_at is explicitly set to the original publication
# date in March 2012.
