# The history
# ===========
#
# Following on from the previous migration where we deleted ids from the
# removed_document_ids field, now we need to make sure that the documents
# referred to by the remaining entries have been correctly withdrawn as if
# the new removal functionality had been in place.
#
# This means setting the state to archived and discarding drafts from the
# publishing-api for any documents in 'draft' state, and creating a new
# edition that we archive and send an unpublishing to the publishing-api.
