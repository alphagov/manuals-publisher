# Manuals publisher

## Purpose

Publishing App for Manuals.

## Nomenclature

* Schema: JSON file defining slug, document noun and name of Specialist Document document_types. Also has select facets and their possible values for each document_type which are displayed by the `_form.html.erb`.
* Manual: Grouped Documents published as a number of sections inside a parent document

### Live address

* Manuals (there's no public index page for Manuals, they can all be found at `gov.uk/guidance/:manual-slug`)
* Specialist Documents - Deprecated, now handled by [Specialist Publisher Rebuild](https://github.com/alphagov/specialist-publisher-rebuild)

## Dependencies

* [alphagov/static](http://github.com/alphagov/static): provides static assets (JS/CSS)
* [alphagov/asset-manager](http://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager): provides uploading for static files
* [alphagov/rummager](http://github.com/alphagov/rummager): allows documents to be indexed for searching in both Finders and site search
* [alphagov/publishing-api](http://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api): allows documents to be published to the Publishing queue
* [alphagov/email-alert-api](http://github.com/alphagov/email-alert-api): sends emails to subscribed users when documents are published

## Running the application

```
$ ./startup.sh
```
If you are using the GDS development virtual machine then the application will be available on the host at http://specialist-publisher.dev.gov.uk/

## Running the test suite

```
$ bundle exec rake
```

## Application Structure

### Directory Structure

Non standard Rails directories and what they're used for:

* `app/exporters`
  These export information to various GOV.UK APIs
  * `app/exporters/formatters`
    These are used by exporters to format information for transferring as JSON
* `app/importers`
  Generic code used when writing importers for scraped content of new document formats
* `app/models`
  Combination of Mongoid documents and Ruby objects for handling Documents and various behaviours
  * `app/models/builders`
    Ruby objects for building a new document by setting ID and subclasses for setting the document type, if needed
  * `app/models/validators`
    Not validators. Decorators for providing validation logic.
* `app/observers`
  Define ordered lists of exporters, called at different stages of a document's life cycle, for example, publication
* `app/presenters`
  Presenters used to format Finders for publishing to the Content Store
* `app/repositories`
  Provide interaction with the persistance layer (Mongoid)
* `app/services`
  Reusable classes for completing actions on documents
* `app/view_adapters`
  Provide classes which allow us to have Rails like form objects in views
* `app/workers`
  Classes for sidekiq workers. Currently the only worker in the App is for publishing Manuals as Manual publishing was timing out due to the large number of document objects inside a Manual


### Services

 Services do things such as previewing a document, creation, updating, showing, withdrawing, queueing. This replaces the normal Rails behaviour of completing these actions directly from a controller, instead we call a service registry.
