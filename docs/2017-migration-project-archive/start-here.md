# Manuals Publisher Migration Project Documentation - Start Here

In 2017, the GoFreeRange team conducted an investigation into potentially migrating Manuals Publisher to persist manual document data in Publishing API rather than the application's own database.

The project was not completed for unspecified reasons, but a substantial amount of documentation was left behind which may be interesting and/or useful to future developers.

The project documentation includes:

1. [History](history.md) - an exploration of the origins and subsequent development of Manuals Publisher up to 2017
2. [Current State](current-state.md) - a brief description of the data model and some parts of the application architecture
3. [Fully Migrated Spike](fully-migrated-spike.md) - documentation of early attempts to have Manuals Publisher store its data via Publishing API
4. [Next Steps](next-steps.md) - steps the GoFreeRange team recommended to continue developing Manuals Publisher. None of these steps were implemented
5. [Rake Tasks](rake-tasks.md) - a list of Rake tasks available for operating Manuals Publisher

Note that while the application hasn't changed hugely since 2017 at the time of writing, this documentation is likely to be out of date in some areas.
