  So that I can prepare the info for publication

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a "DFID" editor

  Scenario: can create a new International Development Fund in draft
    When I create a International Development Fund
    Then the International Development Fund should be in draft

  Scenario: can publish a draft International Development Fund
    Given a draft International Development Fund exists
    When I publish the International Development Fund
    Then the International Development Fund should be published
