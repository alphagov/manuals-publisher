Feature: Publishing a manual
  As an editor
  I want to publish finished manuals
  So that they are available on GOV.UK

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as an editor

  Scenario: Publish a manual
    Given a draft manual exists with a section titled "my test section"
    When I click the publish manual button
    Then I am asked to confirm the publishing of a section titled "my test section"
    When I confirm publishing the manual
    Then the manual and all its sections are published
    And I should see a link to the live manual

  Scenario: Edit and re-publish a manual
    Given a published manual exists
    When I edit one of the manual's sections
    Then the updated section is available to preview
    When I publish the manual
    Then the manual and the edited section are published
    And the sections that I didn't edit were not republished
