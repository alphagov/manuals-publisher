        For now here’s the list of the features we’re working on, with a caveat that we may or may not get the time to deliver them all:
      
        - Moving all pages to the GOV.UK Design System
        - Paste to Govspeak (applies to any body field / editor window)
        - Toggle on/off markdown / editor preview
        - Add internal notes to the Manual
        - Status labels on draft sections (so you know what sections are in draft and not yet published)
        - Confirm publish page (select “publish” and see any sections that will be published if you proceed or the chance to go back if you need to)
      
        We’re also aiming to add these things if we get time:
      
        - 2i and force publish for the Manual (same as Whitehall 2i)
        - Adding images (same as Whitehall minus the cropping tool)
        - Share preview (same as Whitehall)

            You can now paste formatted text into the body field and Manuals publisher will try to convert it into GOV.UK’s version of [Markdown](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/markdown), Govspeak. We hope this feature will save you time when editing content.
  
            This works best when copying and pasting from text editing software like Word or Google Docs. It is less likely to recognise formatting from PDFs.
          
            It will convert:
          
            - headings
            - bullets
            - numbered lists
            - links
            - email links
            
            Other formatting, such as tables, will be removed and only plain text pasted. You’ll need to write the Markdown for these separately.
            
            If you have any questions or feedback about publishing, you can reach us on [publishing-service-feedback@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:publishing-service-feedback@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk). For any other type of support, you can [submit a request via Zendesk](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/).
